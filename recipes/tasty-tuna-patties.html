    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you're ever pressed for time, start with a couple cans of tuna and you'll have a delicious patty in no time that you can serve a number of different ways. Add them to buns with your favorite toppings for sandwiches, serve them alongside a fresh salad, or make smaller versions of them and serve them as appetizers with tartar sauce on the side. There are a lot of great flavor elements in these easy and versatile patties, but the quantities are small so the flavor still comes out pretty mild. If you're looking for a stronger flavor, increase quantities as you like!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (5 ounce) cans tuna in water, drained</li>
        <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons finely diced celery</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil, divided, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine tuna, eggs, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, celery, lemon juice, seafood seasoning, mustard, pepper, and dill in a bowl; stir gently until fully and evenly combined. Shape mixture into 4 patties.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, gently lay 2 tuna patties into the skillet. Don't over crowd - only add as many patties as comfortably fit with room to flip them.</li>
        <li>Cook tuna patties until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side, adjusting the heat as needed if they're cooking too quickly. Repeat with remaining patties, adding remaining oil as needed.</li>
    </ol>
