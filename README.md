# odin-recipes
I will be creating my first website which showcases various recipes and provides details on how they are made as well as the various ingredients required.
This will also put into use the knowledge I built up until now in regards to how to build a website such as how to create the index.html to creating other web pages connected to it as well as how to insert images and link other websites in the internet.
